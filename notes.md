About Infinite Landscapes.

Most landscapes used in computer games rely a technique called Perlin Noise. This involves superimposing randomness at a variety of scales, 
to produce a landscape which is self-similar at all of those scales and which therefore is at least approximately fractal. It is random at
the scale of small pebbles, and also at the scale of medium-sized hillocks, and also at the scale of large mountain peaks.

One good feature of this is that it does resemble closely a certain type of natural terrain. It works best with craggy mountainous areas. 
By reducing vertical height ranges and adding smoothing it is also possible to produce gently rolling hills.

However there are several disadvantages to Perlin Noise. One is that randomness does not tend to result in unique and interesting
features. Landscapes aren't just self-similar, they are also similar to every other Perlin landscape out there, varying primarily in just
height and cragginess. Two distinct landscapes with the same parametric height and cragginess may differ in detail, but the difference, 
being essentially random, is not memorable.

To be continued shortly.
